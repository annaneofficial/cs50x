## 📝 Overview

Week 1 introduces the basics of C programming, including:
- **Data Types:** `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.
- **Control Structures:** `if`, `else if`, `else`, and loops.
- **Functions:** Definition, declaration, and usage.
- **Variables:** Declaration, initialization, and scope.
- **Compiling:** Using `clang` and `make` to compile programs.
- **Debugging:** Using tools like `printf` and `debug50`.
