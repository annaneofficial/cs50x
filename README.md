# 📚 My CS50x Journey

Welcome to my repository, where I document my progress through **CS50's Introduction to Computer Science**, a course offered by Harvard University and widely regarded as one of the best starting points for learning computer science and programming. 🚀

## 🌟 About This Repository

This repository serves as a journal of my learning journey, showcasing my solutions, notes, and projects from the course. Each folder and file represents a specific lecture, problem set, or project I’ve completed. My goal is to share my progress, reflect on what I've learned, and inspire others who might want to start their own journey in computer science.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

- **Week X:** Lecture notes and exercises
- **Problem Sets:** Solutions to the weekly problem sets
- **Projects:** Final projects or additional assignments
- **Reflections:** Notes and thoughts on the key concepts learned each week

## 💻 Technologies & Skills

Throughout the course, I will explore and learn:
- **Programming Languages:** C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Topics:** Algorithms, Data Structures, Memory Management, Web Development, and more
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, and other essential developer tools

## 🚀 Final Project

As part of CS50, I will complete a **final project**, where I apply the knowledge gained throughout the course to build something unique and meaningful. Stay tuned for updates!

## 🌟 My Goals

1. Gain a strong foundation in computer science and programming.
2. Learn problem-solving techniques and best practices.
3. Build confidence to tackle more advanced topics and real-world projects.
4. Document my journey to track my growth and share with the community.

## 🛠️ How to Use This Repository

Feel free to browse through the files and folders to see my progress. If you're also taking CS50, I hope this repository serves as a source of motivation and a learning resource.
