# 🐱 Week 0: Scratch - CS50

Welcome to the Week 0 section of my CS50 journey! This week is all about learning the basics of programming using **Scratch**, a visual programming language developed by MIT. Scratch provides a beginner-friendly environment to explore core programming concepts without worrying about syntax, making it an excellent starting point for new learners.

## 🌟 What I Learned This Week

In Week 0, I was introduced to the following fundamental programming concepts:
- **Sequencing**: Understanding how programs execute instructions in order.
- **Loops**: Automating repetitive tasks using constructs like `forever` and `repeat`.
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions in code using `if` and `if-else` blocks.
- **Variables**: Storing and updating data dynamically.
- **Events**: Triggering actions based on user interactions or other conditions.
- **Functions**: Using custom blocks to organize and reuse code efficiently.

## 🎮 My Scratch Project

For this week, I created a project in Scratch to apply these concepts in a fun and creative way.

# Crab's Banana Catch 🦀🍌

In this exciting Scratch game, you control a hungry crab as it moves across the screen, catching falling bananas to earn points.

## Features 🚀

This game was built using the basics of coding in Scratch, including:

- **Loops**: To keep the bananas falling continuously.  
- **If Statements**: To check if the crab catches a banana or if it touches the ground.  
- **Variables**: To track and update the player’s score and lives.  
- **Events**: To start the game and reset it when needed.  

## Gameplay 🎮

1. Use the arrow keys to move the crab left and right.
2. Catch the bananas to earn points.
3. Avoid missing bananas to keep playing.

With simple mechanics and increasing challenges, _"Crab's Banana Catch"_ is a fun way to see how basic coding concepts can create an engaging game.

## 🌟 Key Takeaways

- Scratch made it easy to grasp the fundamentals of programming, and I now feel confident about exploring more complex languages.
- Building this project taught me how to think like a programmer and break down problems into smaller, manageable steps.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Dive into Week 1: **C Programming**, where I'll write my first lines of code in a text-based language.
- Apply the concepts learned in Scratch to solve real-world problems with syntax-based programming.
