# 🐱 Week 0: Scratch - CS50

Welcome to the Week 0 section of my CS50 journey! This week is all about learning the basics of programming using **Scratch**, a visual programming language developed by MIT. Scratch provides a beginner-friendly environment to explore core programming concepts without worrying about syntax, making it an excellent starting point for new learners.

## 🌟 What I Learned This Week

In Week 0, I was introduced to the following fundamental programming concepts:
- **Sequencing**: Understanding how programs execute instructions in order.
- **Loops**: Automating repetitive tasks using constructs like `forever` and `repeat`.
- **Conditionals**: Making decisions in code using `if` and `if-else` blocks.
- **Variables**: Storing and updating data dynamically.
- **Events**: Triggering actions based on user interactions or other conditions.
- **Functions**: Using custom blocks to organize and reuse code efficiently.

## 🎮 My Scratch Project

For this week, I created a project in Scratch to apply these concepts in a fun and creative way.

### **Project Title**: *[Your Project Name Here]*

### **Description**:
[Write a brief overview of your project. For example: "This project is a simple game where the player controls a sprite to collect stars while avoiding obstacles. It uses loops, conditionals, and variables to manage gameplay and scoring."]

### **Features**:
- **User Interaction**: [Explain how the player interacts with your project, e.g., keyboard or mouse inputs.]
- **Scoring System**: [If applicable, describe how the score is calculated.]
- **Dynamic Elements**: [Explain moving sprites, animations, or other interactive elements.]

## 💡 Challenges Faced

1. [Describe a challenge you faced, e.g., "I had difficulty creating smooth sprite movement."]
2. [Explain how you resolved it or what you learned from the experience.]

## 🖼️ Preview of the Project

[Insert a link to your Scratch project or upload a screenshot of your Scratch workspace here.]

## 🌟 Key Takeaways

- Scratch made it easy to grasp the fundamentals of programming, and I now feel confident about exploring more complex languages.
- Building this project taught me how to think like a programmer and break down problems into smaller, manageable steps.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Dive into Week 1: **C Programming**, where I'll write my first lines of code in a text-based language.
- Apply the concepts learned in Scratch to solve real-world problems with syntax-based programming.
